# Debug and Display

## Debug

All types which want to use `std::fmt` formatting `traits` require an
implementation to be printable. Automatic implementations are only provided
for types such as in the `std` library. All others *must* be manually
implemented somehow.

The `fmt::Debug` `trait` makes this very straightforward. *All* types can
`derive` (automatically create) the `fmt::Debug` implementation. This is
not true for `fmt::Display` which must be manually implemented.

```rust
// This structure cannot be printed either with `fmt::Display` or
// with `fmt::Debug`
struct UnPrintable(i32);

// The `derive` attribute automatically creates the implementation
// required to make this `struct` printable with `fmt::Debug`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct DebugPrintable(i32);
```

All `std` library types automatically are printable with `{:?}` too:

```rust,editable
// Derive the `fmt::Debug` implementation for `Structure`. `Structure`
// is a structure which contains a single `i32`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Structure(i32);

// Put a `Structure` inside of the structure `Deep`. Make it printable
// also.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Deep(Structure);

fn main() {
    // Printing with `{:?}` is similar to with `{}`.
    println!("{:?} months in a year.", 12);
    println!("{1:?} {0:?} is the {actor:?} name.",
             "Slater",
             "Christian",
             actor="actor's");

    // `Structure` is printable!
    println!("Now {:?} will print!", Structure(3));
    
    // The problem with `derive` is there is no control over how
    // the results look. What if I want this to just show a `7`?
    println!("Now {:?} will print!", Deep(Structure(7)));
}
```

So `fmt::Debug` definitely makes this printable but sacrifices some
elegance. Rust also provides "pretty printing" with `{:#?}`.

```rust,editable
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
    age: u8
}

fn main() {
    let name = "Peter";
    let age = 27;
    let peter = Person { name, age };

    // Pretty print
    println!("{:#?}", peter);
}
```

One can manually implement `fmt::Display` to control the display.

## Display

`fmt::Debug` hardly looks compact and clean, so it is often advantageous to
customize the output appearance. This is done by manually implementing
[`fmt::Display`][fmt], which uses the `{}` print marker. Implementing it
looks like this:

```rust
// Import (via `use`) the `fmt` module to make it available.
use std::fmt;

// Define a structure which `fmt::Display` will be implemented for. This is simply
// a tuple struct containing an `i32` bound to the name `Structure`.
struct Structure(i32);

// In order to use the `{}` marker, the trait `fmt::Display` must be implemented
// manually for the type.
impl fmt::Display for Structure {
    // This trait requires `fmt` with this exact signature.
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Write strictly the first element into the supplied output
        // stream: `f`. Returns `fmt::Result` which indicates whether the
        // operation succeeded or failed. Note that `write!` uses syntax which
        // is very similar to `println!`.
        write!(f, "{}", self.0)
    }
}
```

`fmt::Display` may be cleaner than `fmt::Debug` but this presents
a problem for the `std` library. How should ambiguous types be displayed?
For example, if the `std` library implemented a single style for all
`Vec<T>`, what style should it be? Either of these two?

* `Vec<path>`: `/:/etc:/home/username:/bin` (split on `:`)
* `Vec<number>`: `1,2,3` (split on `,`)

No, because there is no ideal style for all types and the `std` library
doesn't presume to dictate one. `fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Vec<T>`
or for any other generic containers. `fmt::Debug` must then be used for these
generic cases.

This is not a problem though because for any new *container* type which is
*not* generic,`fmt::Display` can be implemented.

```rust,editable
use std::fmt; // Import `fmt`

// A structure holding two numbers. `Debug` will be derived so the results can
// be contrasted with `Display`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MinMax(i64, i64);

// Implement `Display` for `MinMax`.
impl fmt::Display for MinMax {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Use `self.number` to refer to each positional data point.
        write!(f, "({}, {})", self.0, self.1)
    }
}

// Define a structure where the fields are nameable for comparison.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point2D {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// Similarly, implement for Point2D
impl fmt::Display for Point2D {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Customize so only `x` and `y` are denoted.
        write!(f, "x: {}, y: {}", self.x, self.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let minmax = MinMax(0, 14);

    println!("Compare structures:");
    println!("Display: {}", minmax);
    println!("Debug: {:?}", minmax);

    let big_range =   MinMax(-300, 300);
    let small_range = MinMax(-3, 3);

    println!("The big range is {big} and the small is {small}",
             small = small_range,
             big = big_range);

    let point = Point2D { x: 3.3, y: 7.2 };

    println!("Compare points:");
    println!("Display: {}", point);
    println!("Debug: {:?}", point);

    // Error. Both `Debug` and `Display` were implemented but `{:b}`
    // requires `fmt::Binary` to be implemented. This will not work.
    // println!("What does Point2D look like in binary: {:b}?", point);
}
```

So, `fmt::Display` has been implemented but `fmt::Binary` has not, and
therefore cannot be used. `std::fmt` has many such [`traits`][traits] and
each requires its own implementation. This is detailed further in
[`std::fmt`][fmt].

### Activity

After checking the output of the above example, use the `Point2D` struct as
guide to add a Complex struct to the example. When printed in the same
way, the output should be:

```txt
Display: 3.3 +7.2i
Debug: Complex { real: 3.3, imag: 7.2 }
```
