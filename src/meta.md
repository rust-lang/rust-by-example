# Meta

Some topics aren't exactly relevant to how you program but provide you tooling
or infrastructure support which just makes things better for everyone. These
topics include:

- [Documentation][doc]: Generate library documentation for users via the
  included `rustdoc`.
- [Playground][playground]: Integrate the Rust Playground in your documentation.

[doc]: meta/doc.md
[playground]: meta/playground.md
