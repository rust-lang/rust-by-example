# Meta

Some topics aren't exactly relevant to how you program but provide you
tooling or infrastructure support which just makes things better for
everyone. These topics include:

- [Documentation][doc]: Generate library documentation for users via the included
  `rustdoc`.
- [Playpen][playpen]: Integrate the Rust Playpen (also known as the Rust Playground) in your documentation.

[doc]: meta/doc.md
[playpen]: meta/playpen.md
