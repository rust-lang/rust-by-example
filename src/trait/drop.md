# Drop

The [`Drop`][Drop] trait only has one method: `drop`, which is called
automatically when an object goes out of scope. The main use of the `Drop` trait
is to free the resources that the implementor instance owns.

`Box`, `Vec`, `String`, `File`, and `Process` are some examples of types that
implement the `Drop` trait to free resources. The `Drop` trait can also be
manually implemented for any custom data type.

The following example adds a print to console to the `drop` function to announce
when it is called.

```rust,editable
struct Droppable {
    name: &'static str,
}

// This trivial implementation of `drop` adds a print to console.
impl Drop for Droppable {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("> Dropping {}", self.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let _a = Droppable { name: "a" };

    // block A
    {
        let _b = Droppable { name: "b" };

        // block B
        {
            let _c = Droppable { name: "c" };
            let _d = Droppable { name: "d" };

            println!("Exiting block B");
        }
        println!("Just exited block B");

        println!("Exiting block A");
    }
    println!("Just exited block A");

    // Variable can be manually dropped using the `drop` function
    drop(_a);
    // TODO ^ Try commenting this line

    println!("end of the main function");

    // `_a` *won't* be `drop`ed again here, because it already has been
    // (manually) `drop`ed
}
```
