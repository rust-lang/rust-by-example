Branching with if-else is similar to C. Unlike C, the boolean condition doesn't need to be surrounded by parentheses, but braces must be used around the following statements.

{if-else.rs}

{if-else.out}

If-else conditionals are expressions and can be used as rvalues in assignments.
Each branch can contain severals statements, and the last expression will be
used for the assignment.

{if-else-expr.rs}

{if-else-expr.out}
