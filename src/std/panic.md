# `panic!`

The `panic!` macro can be used to generate a panic and start unwinding its
stack. While unwinding, the runtime will take care of freeing all the resources
*owned* by the thread by calling the destructor of all its objects.

Since we are dealing with programs with only one thread, `panic!` will cause the
program to report the panic message and exit.

```rust,editable,ignore,mdbook-runnable
// Re-implementation of integer division (/)
fn division(dividend: i32, divisor: i32) -> i32 {
    if divisor == 0 {
        // Division by zero triggers a panic
        panic!("division by zero");
    } else {
        dividend / divisor
    }
}

// The `main` task
fn main() {
    // Heap allocated integer
    let _x = Box::new(0i32);

    // This operation will trigger a task failure
    division(3, 0);

    println!("This point won't be reached!");

    // `_x` should get destroyed at this point
}
```

Let's check that `panic!` doesn't leak memory.
