# Rust by Example

[Rust][rust] is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed,
and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using
garbage collection.

Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate
various Rust concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these
examples, don't forget to [install Rust locally][install] and check out the
[official docs][std]. Additionally for the curious, you can also
[check out the source code for this site][home].

Now let's begin!

- [Hello World](hello.md) - Start with a traditional Hello World program.

- [Primitives](primitives.md) - Learn about signed integers, unsigned integers
  and other primitives.

- [Custom Types](custom_types.md) - `struct` and `enum`.

- [Variable Bindings](variable_bindings.md) - mutable bindings, scope,
  shadowing.

- [Types](types.md) - Learn about changing and defining types.

- [Conversion](conversion.md) - Convert between different types, such as
  strings, integers, and floats.

- [Expressions](expression.md) - Learn about Expressions & how to use them.

- [Flow of Control](flow_control.md) - `if`/`else`, `for`, and others.

- [Functions](fn.md) - Learn about Methods, Closures and Higher Order Functions.

- [Modules](mod.md) - Organize code using modules

- [Crates](crates.md) - A crate is a compilation unit in Rust. Learn to create a
  library.

- [Cargo](cargo.md) - Go through some basic features of the official Rust
  package management tool.

- [Attributes](attribute.md) - An attribute is metadata applied to some module,
  crate or item.

- [Generics](generics.md) - Learn about writing a function or data type which
  can work for multiple types of arguments.

- [Scoping rules](scope.md) - Scopes play an important part in ownership,
  borrowing, and lifetimes.

- [Traits](trait.md) - A trait is a collection of methods defined for an unknown
  type: `Self`

- [Macros](macros.md) - Macros are a way of writing code that writes other code,
  which is known as metaprogramming.

- [Error handling](error.md) - Learn Rust way of handling failures.

- [Std library types](std.md) - Learn about some custom types provided by `std`
  library.

- [Std misc](std_misc.md) - More custom types for file handling, threads.

- [Testing](testing.md) - All sorts of testing in Rust.

- [Unsafe Operations](unsafe.md) - Learn about entering a block of unsafe
  operations.

- [Compatibility](compatibility.md) - Handling Rust's evolution and potential
  compatibility issues.

- [Meta](meta.md) - Documentation, Benchmarking.
