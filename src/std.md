# Std library types

The `std` library provides many custom types which expands drastically on the
`primitives`. Some of these include:

- growable `String`s like: `"hello world"`
- growable vectors: `[1, 2, 3]`
- optional types: `Option<i32>`
- error handling types: `Result<i32, i32>`
- heap allocated pointers: `Box<i32>`
