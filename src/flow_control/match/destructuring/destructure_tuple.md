# tuples

Tuples can be destructured in a `match` as follows:

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    let triple = (0, -2, 3);
    // TODO ^ Try different values for `triple`

    println!("Tell me about {:?}", triple);
    // Match can be used to destructure a tuple
    match triple {
        // Destructure the second and third elements
        (0, y, z) => println!("First is `0`, `y` is {:?}, and `z` is {:?}", y, z),
        (1, ..) => println!("First is `1` and the rest doesn't matter"),
        (.., 2) => println!("last is `2` and the rest doesn't matter"),
        (3, .., 4) => println!("First is `3`, last is `4`, and the rest doesn't matter"),
        // `..` can be used to ignore the rest of the tuple
        _ => println!("It doesn't matter what they are"),
        // `_` means don't bind the value to a variable
    }
}
```
