# Ownership and moves

Because variables are in charge of freeing their own resources, **resources can
only have one owner**. This prevents resources from being freed more than once.
Note that not all variables own resources (e.g. [references]).

When doing assignments (`let x = y`) or passing function arguments by value
(`foo(x)`), the *ownership* of the resources is transferred. In Rust-speak, this
is known as a *move*.

After moving resources, the previous owner can no longer be used. This avoids
creating dangling pointers.

```rust,editable
// This function takes ownership of the heap allocated memory
fn destroy_box(c: Box<i32>) {
    println!("Destroying a box that contains {}", c);

    // `c` is destroyed and the memory freed
}

fn main() {
    // _Stack_ allocated integer
    let x = 5u32;

    // *Copy* `x` into `y` - no resources are moved
    let y = x;

    // Both values can be independently used
    println!("x is {}, and y is {}", x, y);

    // `a` is a pointer to a _heap_ allocated integer
    let a = Box::new(5i32);

    println!("a contains: {}", a);

    // *Move* `a` into `b`
    let b = a;
    // The pointer address of `a` is copied (not the data) into `b`.
    // Both are now pointers to the same heap allocated data, but
    // `b` now owns it.

    // Error! `a` can no longer access the data, because it no longer owns the
    // heap memory
    //println!("a contains: {}", a);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // This function takes ownership of the heap allocated memory from `b`
    destroy_box(b);

    // Since the heap memory has been freed at this point, this action would
    // result in dereferencing freed memory, but it's forbidden by the compiler
    // Error! Same reason as the previous Error
    //println!("b contains: {}", b);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line
}
```
