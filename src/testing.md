# Testing

Rust is a programming language that cares a lot about correctness and it
includes support for writing software tests within the language itself.

Testing comes in three styles:

- [Unit][unit] testing.
- [Doc][doc] testing.
- [Integration][integration] testing.

Also Rust has support for specifying additional dependencies for tests:

- [Dev-dependencies][dev-dependencies]
