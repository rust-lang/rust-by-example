# Error handling

Error handling is the process of handling the possibility of failure. For
example, failing to read a file and then continuing to use that *bad* input
would clearly be problematic. Noticing and explicitly managing those errors
saves the rest of the program from various pitfalls.

For a more rigorous discussion of error handling, refer to the error
handling section in the [official book][book].
