Functions are declared using the `fn` keyword. Its arguments are type
annotated, just like variables, and, if the function returns a value, the
return type must be specified after an arrow `->`.

The final expression in the function will be used as return value.
Alternatively, the `return` statement can be used to return a value earlier
from within the function, even from inside loops or `if`s.

Let's rewrite FizzBuzz using functions!
