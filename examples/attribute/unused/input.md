The compiler provides a `dead_code`
[*lint*][lint] that will warn
about unused functions. An *attribute* can be used to disable the lint.

{unused.play}

Note that in real programs, you should eliminate dead code. In these examples
we'll allow dead code in some places because of the interactive nature of the
examples.
