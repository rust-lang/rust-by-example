"Associated Items" refers to a set of rules pertaining to [`item`][items]s
of various types. It is an extension to `trait` generics, and allows
`trait`s to internally define new items.

One such item is called an *associated type*, providing simpler usage
patterns when the `trait` is generic over its container type.
