# Rust by Example

[Rust][rust] is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety and
speed. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage
collection.

Rust by Example is a collection of examples that illustrate various Rust
concepts and the standard libraries. You can also [check out the source code
for this site][home].

Be sure to have Rust [installed][install] and the [docs][std] at hand, and
let's start!

*Note*: Rust by Example follows the nightly builds until the beta or possibly
the 1.0.0 final release. If you're following along on your computer, make sure
to have the latest Rust installed.
