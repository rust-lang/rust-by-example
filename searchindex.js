Additionally, where clauses can apply bounds to arbitrary types, rather than just to type parameters.

This is extremely useful for reducing code duplication in many ways, but can call for rather involving syntax. Namely, being generic requires taking great care to specify over which types a generic type is actually considered valid. The simplest and most common use of generics is for type parameters. A type parameter is specified as generic by the use of angle brackets and upper camel case : <Aaa, Bbb, ...> . \"Generic type parameters\" are typically represented as <T> . In Rust, \"generic\" also describes anything that accepts one or more generic type parameters <T> . Any type specified as a generic type parameter is generic, and everything else is concrete (non-generic). For example, defining a generic function named foo that takes an argument T of any type: fn foo<T>(arg: T) { ... } Because T has been specified as a generic type parameter using <T> , it is considered generic when used here as (arg: T) . This is the case even if T has previously been defined as a struct . This example shows some of the syntax in action: // A concrete type `A`.\nstruct A; // In defining the type `Single`, the first use of `A` is not preceded by `<A>`.\n// Therefore, `Single` is a concrete type, and `A` is defined as above.\nstruct Single(A);\n// ^ Here is `Single`s first use of the type `A`. // Here, `<T>` precedes the first use of `T`, so `SingleGen` is a generic type.\n// Because the type parameter `T` is generic, it could be anything, including\n// the concrete type `A` defined at the top.\nstruct SingleGen<T>(T); fn main() { // `Single` is concrete and explicitly takes `A`. let _s = Single(A); // Create a variable `_char` of type `SingleGen<char>` // and give it the value `SingleGen('a')`. // Here, `SingleGen` has a type parameter explicitly specified. let _char: SingleGen<char> = SingleGen('a'); // `SingleGen` can also have a type parameter implicitly specified: let _t = SingleGen(A); // Uses `A` defined at the top. let _i32 = SingleGen(6); // Uses `i32`. let _char = SingleGen('a'); // Uses `char`.\n}","title":"Generics","id":"generics.html#generics","breadcrumbs":"Generics"},"scope/lifetime.html#lifetimes":{"breadcrumbs":"Scoping rules » Lifetimes","title":"Lifetimes","body":"A lifetime is a construct the compiler (also called the borrow checker) uses to ensure all borrows are valid.

As a result, the borrow is valid as long as it ends before the lender is destroyed. However, the scope of the borrow is determined by where the reference is used. In the following example and in the rest of this section, we will see how lifetimes relate to scopes, as well as how the two differ. // Lifetimes are annotated below with lines denoting the creation\n// and destruction of each variable.\n// `i` has the longest lifetime because its scope entirely encloses // both `borrow1` and `borrow2`.

If you have ever managed dependencies by hand, you know how much of a pain this can be. Luckily, the Rust ecosystem comes standard with cargo ! cargo can manage dependencies for a project. To create a new Rust project, # A binary\ncargo new foo # OR A library\ncargo new --lib foo For the rest of this chapter, I will assume we are making a binary, rather than a library, but all of the concepts are the same. After the above commands, you should see something like this: foo\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src └── main.rs The main.rs is the root source file for your new project -- nothing new there. The Cargo.toml is the config file for cargo for this project ( foo ). If you look inside it, you should see something like this: [package]\nname = \"foo\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"mark\"] [dependencies] You can read more extensively about all of the available configuration options here . The name field under package determines the name of the project. This is used by crates.io if you publish the crate (more later). It is also the name of the output binary when you compile. The version field is a crate version number using Semantic Versioning . The authors field is a list of authors used when publishing the crate. The dependencies section lets you add a dependency for your project. For example, suppose that I want my program to have a great CLI. You can find lots of great packages on crates.io (the official Rust package registry). One popular choice is clap . As of this writing, the most recent published version of clap is 2.27.1 . To add a dependency to our program, we can simply add the following to our Cargo.toml under dependencies : clap = \"2.27.1\" . And of course, extern crate clap in main.rs , just like normal. And that's it! You can start using clap in your program. cargo also supports other types of dependencies. Here is just a small sampling. You can find out more here .

We can also do cargo run to build and run. Notice that these commands will resolve all dependencies, download crates if needed, and build everything, including your crate.

When taking a closure as an input parameter, the closure's complete type must be annotated using one of a few traits . In order of decreasing restriction, they are: Fn : the closure captures by reference ( &T ) FnMut : the closure captures by mutable reference ( &mut T ) FnOnce : the closure captures by value ( T ) On a variable-by-variable basis, the compiler will capture variables in the least restrictive manner possible. For instance, consider a parameter annotated as FnOnce . This specifies that the closure may capture by &T , &mut T , or T , but the compiler will ultimately choose based on how the captured variables are used in the closure. This is because if a move is possible, then any type of borrow should also be possible. Note that the reverse is not true. If the parameter is annotated as Fn , then capturing variables by &mut T or T are not allowed. In the following example, try swapping the usage of Fn , FnMut , and FnOnce to see what happens: // A function which takes a closure as an argument and calls it.\nfn apply<F>(f: F) where // The closure takes no input and returns nothing.

The following example adds a print to console to the drop function to announce when it is called. struct Droppable { name: &'static str,\n} // This trivial implementation of `drop` adds a print to console.\nimpl Drop for Droppable { fn drop(&mut self) { println!(\"> Dropping {}\", self.name); }\n} fn main() { let _a = Droppable { name: \"a\" }; // block A { let _b = Droppable { name: \"b\" }; // block B { let _c = Droppable { name: \"c\" }; let _d = Droppable { name: \"d\" }; println!(\"Exiting block B\"); } println!(\"Just exited block B\"); println!(\"Exiting block A\"); } println!(\"Just exited block A\"); // Variable can be manually dropped using the `drop` function drop(_a); // TODO ^ Try commenting this line println!(\"end of the main function\"); // `_a` *won't* be `drop`ed again here, because it already has been // (manually) `drop`ed\n}","id":"trait/drop.html#drop","breadcrumbs":"Traits » Drop","title":"Drop"},"scope/lifetime/static_lifetime.html#see-also":{"id":"scope/lifetime/static_lifetime.html#see-also","body":"'static constants","breadcrumbs":"Scoping rules » Lifetimes » See also:","title":"See also:"},"std_misc/fs.html#filesystem-operations":{"body":"The std::io::fs module contains several functions that deal with the filesystem. use std::fs;\nuse std::fs::{File, OpenOptions};\nuse std::io;\nuse std::io::prelude::*;\nuse std::os::unix;\nuse std::path::Path; // A simple implementation of `% cat path`\nfn cat(path: &Path) -> io::Result<String> { let mut f = File::open(path)?; let mut s = String::new(); match f.read_to_string(&mut s) { Ok(_) => Ok(s), Err(e) => Err(e), }\n} // A simple implementation of `% echo s > path`\nfn echo(s: &str, path: &Path) -> io::Result<()> { let mut f = File::create(path)?; f.write_all(s.as_bytes())\n} // A simple implementation of `% touch path` (ignores existing files)\nfn touch(path: &Path) -> io::Result<()> { match OpenOptions::new().create(true).write(true).open(path) { Ok(_) => Ok(()), Err(e) => Err(e), }\n} fn main() { println!(\"`mkdir a`\"); // Create a directory, returns `io::Result<()>` match fs::create_dir(\"a\") { Err(why) => println!(\"! {:?}\", why.kind()), Ok(_) => {}, } println!(\"`echo hello > a/b.txt`\"); // The previous match can be simplified using the `unwrap_or_else` method echo(\"hello\", &Path::new(\"a/b.txt\")).unwrap_or_else(|why| { println!(\"! {:?}\", why.kind()); }); println!(\"`mkdir -p a/c/d`\"); // Recursively create a directory, returns `io::Result<()>` fs::create_dir_all(\"a/c/d\").unwrap_or_else(|why| { println!(\"! {:?}\", why.kind()); }); println!(\"`touch a/c/e.txt`\"); touch(&Path::new(\"a/c/e.txt\")).unwrap_or_else(|why| { println!(\"! {:?}\", why.kind()); }); println!(\"`ln -s ../b.txt a/c/b.txt`\"); // Create a symbolic link, returns `io::Result<()>` if cfg!(target_family = \"unix\") { unix::fs::symlink(\"../b.txt\", \"a/c/b.txt\").unwrap_or_else(|why| { println!(\"! {:?}\", why.kind()); }); } println!(\"`cat a/c/b.txt`\"); match cat(&Path::new(\"a/c/b.txt\")) { Err(why) => println!(\"! {:?}\", why.kind()), Ok(s) => println!(\"> {}\", s), } println!(\"`ls a`\"); // Read the contents of a directory, returns `io::Result<Vec<Path>>` match fs::read_dir(\"a\") { Err(why) => println!(\"! {:?}\", why.kind()), Ok(paths) => for path in paths { println!(\"> {:?}\", path.unwrap().path()); }, } println!(\"`rm a/c/e.txt`\"); // Remove a file, returns `io::Result<()>` fs::remove_file(\"a/c/e.txt\").unwrap_or_else(|why| { println!(\"! {:?}\", why.kind()); }); println!(\"`rmdir a/c/d`\"); // Remove an empty directory, returns `io::Result<()>` fs::remove_dir(\"a/c/d\").unwrap_or_else(|why| { println!(\"! {:?}\", why.kind()); });\n} Here's the expected successful output: $ rustc fs.rs && ./fs\n`mkdir a`\n`echo hello > a/b.txt`\n`mkdir -p a/c/d`\n`touch a/c/e.txt`\n`ln -s ../b.txt a/c/b.txt`\n`cat a/c/b.txt`\n> hello\n`ls a`\n> \"a/b.txt\"\n> \"a/c\"\n`rm a/c/e.txt`\n`rmdir a/c/d` And the final state of the a directory is: $ tree a\na\n|-- b.txt\n`-- c `-- b.txt -> ../b.txt 1 directory, 2 files An alternative way to define the function cat is with ? notation: fn cat(path: &Path) -> io::Result<String> { let mut f = File::open(path)?; let mut s = String::new(); f.read_to_string(&mut s)?; Ok(s)\n}","breadcrumbs":"Std misc » Filesystem Operations","title":"Filesystem Operations","id":"std_misc/fs.html#filesystem-operations"},"std.html#see-also":{"body":"primitives and the std library","breadcrumbs":"See also:","id":"std.html#see-also","title":"See also:"},"std/hash/hashset.html#hashset":{"body":"Consider a HashSet as a HashMap where we just care about the keys ( HashSet<T> is, in actuality, just a wrapper around HashMap<T, ()> ). \"What's the point of that?\" you ask. \"I could just store the keys in a Vec .\" A HashSet 's unique feature is that it is guaranteed to not have duplicate elements. That's the contract that any set collection fulfills. HashSet is just one implementation.

For example, failing to read a file and then continuing to use that bad input would clearly be problematic. Noticing and explicitly managing those errors saves the rest of the program from various pitfalls. There are various ways to deal with errors in Rust, which are described in the following subchapters. They all have more or less subtle differences and different use cases. As a rule of thumb: An explicit panic is mainly useful for tests and dealing with unrecoverable errors. For prototyping it can be useful, for example when dealing with functions that haven't been implemented yet, but in those cases the more descriptive unimplemented is better. In tests panic is a reasonable way to explicitly fail. The Option type is for when a value is optional or when the lack of a value is not an error condition. For example the parent of a directory - / and C: don't have one. When dealing with Option s, unwrap is fine for prototyping and cases where it's absolutely certain that there is guaranteed to be a value. However expect is more useful since it lets you specify an error message in case something goes wrong anyway.

Note that `write!` uses syntax which // is very similar to `println!`. write!(f, \"{}\", self.0) }\n} fmt::Display may be cleaner than fmt::Debug but this presents a problem for the std library. How should ambiguous types be displayed? For example, if the std library implemented a single style for all Vec<T> , what style should it be? Either of these two? Vec<path> : /:/etc:/home/username:/bin (split on : ) Vec<number> : 1,2,3 (split on , ) No, because there is no ideal style for all types and the std library doesn't presume to dictate one. fmt::Display is not implemented for Vec<T> or for any other generic containers. fmt::Debug must then be used for these generic cases. This is not a problem though because for any new container type which is not generic, fmt::Display can be implemented. use std::fmt; // Import `fmt` // A structure holding two numbers. `Debug` will be derived so the results can\n// be contrasted with `Display`.\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct MinMax(i64, i64); // Implement `Display` for `MinMax`.\nimpl fmt::Display for MinMax { fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result { // Use `self.number` to refer to each positional data point. write!(f, \"({}, {})\", self.0, self.1) }\n} // Define a structure where the fields are nameable for comparison.\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Point2D { x: f64, y: f64,\n} // Similarly, implement for Point2D\nimpl fmt::Display for Point2D { fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result { // Customize so only `x` and `y` are denoted. write!(f, \"x: {}, y: {}\", self.x, self.y) }\n} fn main() { let minmax = MinMax(0, 14); println!(\"Compare structures:\"); println!(\"Display: {}\", minmax); println!(\"Debug: {:?}\", minmax); let big_range = MinMax(-300, 300); let small_range = MinMax(-3, 3); println!(\"The big range is {big} and the small is {small}\", small = small_range, big = big_range); let point = Point2D { x: 3.3, y: 7.2 }; println!(\"Compare points:\"); println!(\"Display: {}\", point); println!(\"Debug: {:?}\", point); // Error.

Additionally, this lifetime syntax indicates that the lifetime of foo may not exceed that of 'a . Explicit annotation of a type has the form &'a T where 'a has already been introduced.

Alas, because and_then is not sufficiently flexible, it cannot. However, we can instead use ? . ? was previously explained as either unwrap or return Err(err) . This is only mostly true.

Since From::from is a conversion utility between different types, this means that if you ? where the error is convertible to the return type, it will convert automatically. Here, we rewrite the previous example using ? .

They are marked using ! , which is an empty type. fn foo() -> ! { panic!(\"This call never returns.\");\n} As opposed to all the other types, this one cannot be instantiated, because the set of all possible values this type can have is empty. Note, that it is different from the () type, which has exactly one possible value.

The main advantage of this type is that it can be cast to any other one and therefore used at places where an exact type is required, for instance in match branches. This allows us to write code like this: fn main() { fn sum_odd_numbers(up_to: u32) -> u32 { let mut acc = 0; for i in 0..up_to { // Notice that the return type of this match expression must be u32 // because of the type of the \"addition\" variable. let addition: u32 = match i%2 == 1 { // The \"i\" variable is of type u32, which is perfectly fine. true => i, // On the other hand, the \"continue\" expression does not return // u32, but it is still fine, because it never returns and therefore // does not violate the type requirements of the match expression. false => continue, }; acc += addition; } acc } println!(\"Sum of odd numbers up to 9 (excluding): {}\", sum_odd_numbers(9));\n} It is also the return type of functions that loop forever (e.g. loop {} ) like network servers or functions that terminates the process (e.g. exit() )."},"error/result.html#result":{"breadcrumbs":"Error handling » Result","id":"error/result.html#result","body":"Result is a richer version of the Option type that describes possible error instead of possible absence . That is, Result<T, E> could have one of two outcomes: Ok<T> : An element T was found Err<E> : An error was found with element E By convention, the expected outcome is Ok while the unexpected outcome is Err . Like Option , Result has many methods associated with it. unwrap() , for example, either yields the element T or panic s. For case handling, there are many combinators between Result and Option that overlap. In working with Rust, you will likely encounter methods that return the Result type, such as the parse() method. It might not always be possible to parse a string into the other type, so parse() returns a Result indicating possible failure. Let's see what happens when we successfully and unsuccessfully parse() a string: fn multiply(first_number_str: &str, second_number_str: &str) -> i32 { // Let's try using `unwrap()` to get the number out. Will it bite us? let first_number = first_number_str.parse::<i32>().unwrap(); let second_number = second_number_str.parse::<i32>().unwrap(); first_number * second_number\n} fn main() { let twenty = multiply(\"10\", \"2\"); println!(\"double is {}\", twenty); let tt = multiply(\"t\", \"2\"); println!(\"double is {}\", tt);\n} In the unsuccessful case, parse() leaves us with an error for unwrap() to panic on.
